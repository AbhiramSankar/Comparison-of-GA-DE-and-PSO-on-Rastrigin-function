Optimize the two-dimensional Rastrigin function.
f(x,y)= 20 + x² + y² - 10 [cos(2π x) + cos(2πy)]
over the domain 
-5.12 ≤ x ≤ 5.12,-5.12 ≤ y ≤ 5.12.
This function is highly multimodal, with a global minimum at (0, 0) where f(0, 0) = 0. Your task is to implement three population-based metaheuristics—Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)—to locate the global minimum, record and plot their convergence behaviour, and compare their performance in terms of convergence speed, solution quality, and sensitivity to parameter settings.
